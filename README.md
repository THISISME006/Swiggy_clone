# Swiggy_clone

Welcome to our Swiggy Clone repository! This project aims to recreate the user interface of the popular food ordering and delivery platform, Swiggy. With this clone, users can easily browse through menus, add items to their cart, and place orders for their favorite restaurants.


This repository contains the front-end code for the Swiggy Clone. The user interface is built using HTML and CSS. 

To get started with the Swiggy Clone, you can simply clone this repository and open the index.html file in your web browser. The homepage will display a list of popular restaurants in your area, and you can click on each restaurant to view their menu.


We have also included a sample shopping cart page where users can review their order and proceed to checkout. The checkout process is not functional in this clone, but you can use this code as a starting point for building your own food ordering and delivery platform.


Thank you for checking out our Swiggy Clone! If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to open an issue or contact us directly.
